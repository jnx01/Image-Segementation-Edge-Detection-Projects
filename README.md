## Image Segementation, Edge Detection Projects

- Read the image. Write a function named ‘mylaplacian’ to MANUALLY code/implement 2nd order derivate of above read image in order to extract horizontal and vertical edges, collectively. Also, compare your results with ‘Sobel’ filter and state your findings.

- Find the horizontal and vertical edges in the following picture. Display both horizontal, vertical and combined edges. Use a sobel filter. Implement both using the filter and the built-in function.

- Read the image ‘coin’, you have to get the required output image shown in figure below. Analyze the input image and make the decision yourself what to do to get the required output. 

- Read the image ‘lines.png’. Use the opening operator to separate horizontal and vertical lines.

- You are provided with a printed document image (Image.png). You need to find the approximate number of lines and words in the given image.

- Create an image through paint, snipping or even your mobile. The image should have a white background and your name written in it as foreground. Detect the text in the image and make a bounding box around it is using morphological operations.
